MANUAL FOR SYSTEM SIMULATOR:

[I] HOW TO BUILD:

Run make, as a result You will get debug and release binaries in bin folder.
You must have support for pthreads in order to build and run threaded versions.

[II] HOW TO USE:

To simulate first three periods of system, run First_Period for non-threaded
version and FPT for threaded version. Help for these programs can be invoked
using -h flag. Threaded version gives about x2 boost on i5 processor.

[III] ADDITIONAL HELP:

1) Recoverable systems.
\t - tab
\n - newline
Syntaxis of a system file:
<total number of systems>\t<number of primitive systems>\t<number of brigades>\n
First complex systems appear.
<number of systems in bundle>\t<bundle type>\t<indexes of systems in bundle>
Then You define the bricks of complex systems.
<lambda>\t<mu>

Output shall be forwarded to file where you wish to store simulation data.

[IV] MINOR NOTE:

Use -h Luke!
